# Windows *ShadowMove* Socket Duplication

## Description

The tool (/POC) is a simple programming exercise in order to replicate the socket duplication technique explained in [ShadowMove: A Stealthy Lateral Movement Strategy](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec20summer_niakanlahiji_prepub.pdf).

My purpose for this tool was to trigger events that can be monitored / logged and later used for endpoint detection.
